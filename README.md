# Basil (A Magento Theme)
Basil is an experimental theme for Magento 2 that uses the new GraphQL API to display the catalog.
It is written with React, Next.js and Apollo. Currently, Basil only displays the catalog since the full
checkout and customer management functionality has not been included in
Magento's GraphQL API [yet](https://github.com/magento/graphql-ce/wiki/Roadmap).
The theme is just a prototype so it is not responsive and needs some code cleanup and unit tests, but I wanted to
share what I have been able to build so far.

To see a preview of the theme, you can view [https://basil.andrewdavis.me](https://basil.andrewdavis.me).
